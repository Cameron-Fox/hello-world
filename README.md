The hello-world tutorial repository

Hello,

My name is Cameron Windsor Fox, I am a person that loves video games and technology. I have always had a big interest in playing video games as well as learning how to code and develop them. I currently try to learn and work in code programming for both video games and app development (App development is more for searching for a full-time job and video game development is a hobby I am working on).

I want to expand my knowledge and try to learn more on programming to see wha I can really do with writing code and see what I can create myself as I learn new languages and gain more experience through out my life. I hope to add more to my resume and add new repos that show all the progress I have made as a programmer and developer as I go through out my life.

Sincerely,
Cameron-Fox
